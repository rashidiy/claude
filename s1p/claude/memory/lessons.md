## Cross-Repo Changes Need a Contract

**Source:** Auth flow refactor (2026-03-08)
**What happened:** httpOnly cookie auth broke refresh flow — backend required body param while frontend stopped sending it.
**Lesson:** When a change spans backend + frontend, write the exact request/response contract and give it to BOTH agents.

## Tell QA About Known Exceptions

**Source:** QA cycles (2026-03-08)
**What happened:** Intentionally deferred Alembic migrations but didn't tell QA. QA flagged as FAIL.
**Lesson:** When sending to QA, list what was intentionally deferred.

## Soft Delete Needs Full-Stack Thinking

**Source:** Pre-prod audit (2026-03-08)
**What happened:** Soft-deleted contacts left orphaned leads/deals with no indication in UI.
**Lesson:** When adding soft delete: list query filters, related entity display ("deleted" labels), cascade behavior.
